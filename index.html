                    Computer science education at Texas State University is being held back by the ways in which it is
                    taught. Traditional lecturing methods of teaching ignore the growth of vital skills such as
                    collaborative learning [2]. In addition, Texas State has experienced a notably high freshman dropout
                    rate among CS students, averaging 35% from fall 2011 to spring 2022 [4]. As the demand for software
                    engineering and computer science skills continues to rise [1], so will the importance of providing a
                    solid computer science education to Texas State students. Our research has found alternative
                    learning methods that better develop important skills and provide a more robust and high-quality
                    learning experience.

                <p>
                    Here we discuss the alternative learning methods that we found, and how they can provide benefits to
                    Texas State's computer science program.

                            The majority of the computer science classes offered at Texas State focus solely on
                            individual work. Projects are assigned on a weekly or biweekly basis, with students each
                            submitting individual code files. This method of teaching severely neglects collaborative
                            skills that are in high demand in software engineering roles [3, 5]. In addition,
                            Collaborative programming has seen massive success at other schools, including the
                            University of Arizona, where students work in groups and collaborate on solving problems
                            given by the professor. This class structure was shown to massively increase student
                            participation, even in an environment where it was not compulsive [6]. Introducing this
                            structure into our own computer science classes would undoubtedly reap similar rewards.

                            Students are typically assigned very short projects, rarely exceeding a few hundred lines of
                            code. This could not be less representative of real software however. For example, Google,
                            one of the most widely used pieces of software on the planet, is estimated to have around 2
                            billion lines of code in it's code base. Other pieces of software such as Microsoft Windows
                            and Linux each have several million lines of code. Of course, asking students to program
                            millions of lines of code is unreasonable, but if students are to be prepared for working on
                            projects of such scale in their careers, they must be exposed to projects that take longer
                            than a few hours to complete.
